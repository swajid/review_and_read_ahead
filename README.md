Stuff
- [ ] [make own `%>%`'s for stuff like this project, `tidybulk`](https://github.com/stemangiola/tidybulk) <!-- (no offense to the author(s)'s hard work) soapbox: great idea for intro but I personally wouldn't use the tidyverse with bioinformatics b/c bioconductor is already complicated enough BUT this is a good way to write WRAPPER functions/pipes to "tidyize" (i.e. make the code cleaner to read) BASE (non-tidyverse) R code --> 
- [ ] add to code chunks/templates on bottom (old/new code, notes on Perl from bioinfo etc.) 

<!-- 
I will keep this as one long document because that is what works for ME (the author and reader of this document) ; 
duplicated lines are also OKAY ;  
although it is open source, it is stuff that I ENJOY ; 
otherwise, here is a more official one: https://github.com/harvardinformatics/learning-bioinformatics-at-home or build/make your own list of resources
--->

**@ myself!!! must update this page!!!!** [[super good thread with ideas]](https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett/status/1212566782436761600) [[+ this heatmap]](https://twitter.com/IyueSung/status/1212781280724766720)

~ Icon Rules:

* Link type - black & white, filled: <img src="./icons/svg/cloud-download.svg" width="15" height="15"> <img src="./icons/svg/logo-twitter.svg" width="15" height="15">
* Link content: cs/db/bio etc : outline <img src="./icons/svg/server-outline.svg" width="15" height="15">
* Section or Link difficulty/amount I've read through - color (maybe green, yellow, red)
* Icon size - something

Eventually: automate the markdown via R and [[gmailR]](https://github.com/r-lib/gmailr)

```
* C is the best programming language

* No one can multi-task

* Whenever I get stressed out, I find a recipe and I make it (but I always follow the recipe 
  exactly the first time around, give myself feedback and then then deviate on next try)

* Pacman, tetris -- these are also examples of software/interfaces that have lasted

* People still use COBOL, because it still works (for what they want to do)

* Learning (a) new language(s) gives you an opportunity to think about the world differently, 
  it expands your vocabulary but it also requires practice

* Be yourself (don't stay the same)

* ---> You just have to be the best representation of yourself <--- (the rest you can't worry about too much)

* Set a deadline for yourself and after that passes, move on to the next thing (in context of working 
  on multiple projects/things at one time)

* The Australian Cricket Team uses pickle juice for electrolytes and muscle cramps

* Look on the brightside; don't always have to be so serious

* Well, I'm getting older too, I'm turning 61, sooooo what, everyone gets older

* Ice cream that's made out of avocados is just a frozen salad (lol)

* You're on the right path, just keep applying and moving forward

* Sana, I am a way more sensitive person than you

* I now pronounce you 4 minutes older

* Have a monthly budget for everything (including time)

* Reviewing and keeping meeting minutes is boring but you'll have more productive and focused meetings

* Print out a copy of your presentation beforehand and give everyone a copy -- so it doesn't 
   get lost in email etc and people can write notes.

* Senator Elizabeth Warren is the Kennedy of our time

* Start your day early, finish early

* My first job after college had a library for tech books and they had an official book on 
  COBOL by IBM that was imported, but they kept it on a bookshelf that was behind glass and 
  it was locked so no one could read it and you could only look at it (the cover of the book). 
  Now, anyone can learn whatever they want. (Hopefully useful stuff)

```
 The process:
 
     1. Have design document __open__ and visible:
        always get a written approval
        
     2. Reproducible research that is __open__ and visible
        Code comments
        Git
        Containerization (Docker)
        Dynamic documents (Jupyter, markdown)
     
     3. Password protect original research, encrypt emails to advisers/everyone
     
        "It's a box of chocolates, you never know what will happen, but protect your work" - dad
     
     "Stay away from difficult/mean people" - dad (~2011)
         Or one if cannot, minimize their influence over work/life (1,2,3) subprocess:
             Keep their criticism / comments / negativity in email as much as possible
             Stay away from in person meetings or make them as short as possible 
                Send out meeting minutes afterwards (takes 5-10 minutes but makes a big difference)
             Make hard copy of presentations, date it, file it in a folder
             Remember to use privacy screen in public places
             Stay away from difficult people who don't support/cite the work of 
                 women & underrepresented people in STEM
             Stay away from difficult people who draw lines, gatekeep, build hoops for talented 
                 people to jump through <- tribalism / crab mentality -> could even become dishonest (hence 1,2,3)
             Try to not correct a difficult person (they will always remember it and use it against you one day)
                 keep it in email and as positive as possible, but delegate as much as possible
                    e.g. here is software that does that check for you or here is a paper that explains this stuff

     Talk out loud

     "Don't respond to the negativity, focus on your own work, always" - dad
     
     "Don't give people with too much time on their hands something to do" - undergrad research adviser 1
     
     "It is your legacy" - undergrad research adviser 2
     
     "Lousy people can do a lot of damage, you'd be surprised, they find other lousy people and before you know it" - dad

     Work with everyone / "the more the merrier" - undergrad research adviser 3

     (Literally not directed at or a response to anything, 
        I just realized I have to get my work done and this is the process-ish)
        
     (Really for me because I don't want to end up becoming a difficult/lousy person ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )

    library(profvis)
    profvis({
      estimateDispersionsGeneEst(dds)
    })
    and you get a nicely rendered overview how much time the program spend on each line of code in that function.
    Result from profvis in RStudio. It immediately tells you where the function call spends most time. In this case, the estimateDispersionGeneEst() function spends 85% of the time (550 ms) in the internal C++ function fitDisp() function.

```
Essentially two steps have to be taken:

set the S3 class of the object to "data.table", "data.frame" in Rcpp

  Rcpp::List create_data_table() {
      Rcpp::List res;

      // Populate the list
      // ...

      res.attr("class") = Rcpp::CharacterVector::create("data.table", "data.frame");
      return res;
  }

in R call the data.table::setalloccol(df) function on the “partial” data.table

  foo <- function() {
      dt <- create_data_table()
      dt <- data.table::setalloccol(dt)
      return(dt)
  }

```
"
I did a Twitter poll recently asking how many times people have rewritten basic user 
registration functions. And from that poll I extrapolate that the basic user registration 
function has been written at least a million times.

Within organizations, the level of duplication you get is astoundingly high. <-- !!!!

People think government is inefficient — well, the worst example I’ve seen of duplication 
in government was 118 systems doing pretty much exactly the same thing.
In the private sector, I’ve seen banks with up to a thousand risk management systems all 
doing the same thing. Multiply that out across the world and you have millions, tens of 
millions, of duplicated systems. 

A lot of what we do in IT, I’m sorry to say, is waste. But radically changing your 
architecture to focus on the functions that actually provide value is a big shift, and it’s 
not as comfortable as saying: “Hey, I’ve got a container! I can move it around between 
providers, and it’s more similar to the environments I’m used to.”

I’m a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the reason I call myself by my childhood name
is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child. If [they] see a thing, [they] must
say that [they] see it, whether it was what [they] thought [they] were going to see or not. See first,
think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most
scientists forget that.

Essentially two steps have to be taken:

set the S3 class of the object to "data.table", "data.frame" in Rcpp

  Rcpp::List create_data_table() {
      Rcpp::List res;

      // Populate the list
      // ...

      res.attr("class") = Rcpp::CharacterVector::create("data.table", "data.frame");
      return res;
  }

in R call the data.table::setalloccol(df) function on the “partial” data.table

  foo <- function() {
      dt <- create_data_table()
      dt <- data.table::setalloccol(dt)
      return(dt)
  }

"Sometimes, when we lose ourselves, in fear and despair, in routine and constancy, in hopelessness 
and tragedy, we can thank God for Bavarian sugar cookies. ... And we must remember that all these 
things, the nuances, the anomalies, the subtleties, which we assume only accessorize our days are, 
in fact, here for a much larger and nobler cause." 
- `Stranger than fiction (2006)`

```
"Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
In separate bowl, mix together egg, milk, vegetable oil and bananas.
Stir flour mixture into banana mixture; batter will be a little lumpy.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
Pour or scoop batter onto pan, using about 1/4 cup for each pancake.
Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides."
