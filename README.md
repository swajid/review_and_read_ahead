- [ ] add to code chunks/templates on bottom (old/new code, notes on Perl from bioinfo etc.) 

<!-- 
I will keep this as one long document because that is what works for ME (the author and reader of this document) ; 
duplicated lines are also OKAY ;  
although it is open source, it is stuff that I ENJOY ; 
otherwise, here is a more official one: https://github.com/harvardinformatics/learning-bioinformatics-at-home or build/make your own list of resources

~ Icon Rules:

* Link type - black & white, filled: <img src="./icons/svg/cloud-download.svg" width="15" height="15"> <img src="./icons/svg/logo-twitter.svg" width="15" height="15">
* Link content: cs/db/bio etc : outline <img src="./icons/svg/server-outline.svg" width="15" height="15">
* Section or Link difficulty/amount I've read through - color (maybe green, yellow, red)
* Icon size - something
* SEG = Software Engineering at Google

Eventually: automate the markdown via R and [[gmailR]](https://github.com/r-lib/gmailr)

```
* C is the best programming language

* No one can multi-task

* Whenever I get stressed out, I find a recipe and I make it (but I always follow the recipe 
  exactly the first time around, give myself feedback and then then deviate on next try)

* Pacman, tetris -- these are also examples of software/interfaces that have lasted

* People still use COBOL, because it still works (for what they want to do)

* Learning (a) new language(s) gives you an opportunity to think about the world differently, 
  it expands your vocabulary but it also requires practice

* Be yourself (don't stay the same)

* ---> You just have to be the best representation of yourself <--- (the rest you can't worry about too much)

* Set a deadline for yourself and after that passes, move on to the next thing (in context of working 
  on multiple projects/things at one time)

* The Australian Cricket Team uses pickle juice for electrolytes and muscle cramps

* Look on the brightside; don't always have to be so serious

* Well, I'm getting older too, I'm turning 61, sooooo what, everyone gets older

* Ice cream that's made out of avocados is just a frozen salad (lol)

* You're on the right path, just keep applying and moving forward

* Sana, I am a way more sensitive person than you

* I now pronounce you 4 minutes older

* Have a monthly budget for everything (including time)

* Reviewing and keeping meeting minutes is boring but you'll have more productive and focused meetings

* Print out a copy of your presentation beforehand and give everyone a copy -- so it doesn't 
   get lost in email etc and people can write notes.

* Senator Elizabeth Warren is the Kennedy of our time

* Start your day early, finish early

* My first job after college had a library for tech books and they had an official book on 
  COBOL by IBM that was imported, but they kept it on a bookshelf that was behind glass and 
  it was locked so no one could read it and you could only look at it (the cover of the book). 
  Now, anyone can learn whatever they want. (Hopefully useful stuff)

* You have to enjoy your life, it's a good life, now go jump in the pool and enjoy your life

* Work with everyone.

* Don't share anything until you have actual information as to what is going on (what's been 
going on for years, why all these manipulative people are involved etc.), where it is all going.
When they (stalkers) have no new information, they will just go away on their own.

* There is always someone out there that is purposely going to ruin a good thing for you (~2011)*

* Not very bright people fight on the bus with strangers/other people on the bus, get their clothes 
dirty and muddied up before reaching their stop, if you don't like the person you have to sit next 
to for a short bus ride, keep yourself busy or look outside the window -- ignore them, 
don't give them any attention.

* Don't argue back with an argumentative mad person (someone who just only thrives when there is conflict, 
if there is no conflict, they'll just create a conflict out of thin air), and then conflict becomes something 
that is more exciting/thrilling and they'll just keep pulling you into their hurricane,
they also have a lot more free time than you do. Just recognize it, ignore/block etc. (Mar 7, 2021)

* You have to have all sorts of experiences in life, even bad experiences, sometimes.

- my dad
```

```
* Everything that has happened to us, our family, has always been the best possible thing
at the best possible time, always. It's always been exactly what we needed, every time.

- my mom
```

<!-- Currently working on
- [x] stuff related to a secret paper I mentioned over the summer, it is a challenge to understand it, the idea behind it is that it deals with a lot of data, person who can expand it (I think) should have more interesting data as an input (I think it can be repurposed for many different things related to metagenomics). so that's what i'm thinking about, repurposing it not for it's original use (something related to one thing) but repurposing the idea (it's by someone who knows what they're doing), but in order to understand it, have to know what some libraries are doing, in general, maybe right now best way to think about them is through the world of images and audio. so atleast there are two huge parts. 1. model 2. data . I think #2 is something that's gotten easier to program over the past couple of years or so was stated by my former coworker in Bethesda (oh there's so much I can't even write about related to this but in general, that's what I'm reading/working on), trying to connect the data that will be available to me to this paper I think is very creative and ahead of its time
* why images and audio/video and not like actual RNA-seq data, well because it's better documented
* i think, a model-centric thesis will keep me away from the incestious mcpoyle riff-raff and eventually (years later with a lot of hard work) put me in different conferences, lots of new stuff to learn but would be worth it long-term
* i am just going to continue to ignore the two predators (+ what other freakshow is out there), it's like a clown looking for attention but now in panic mode that wants to ruin anything and everything possible (but has been quite unsuccessful so far lol), they're asymptote'd average sore losers (imagine if i was still working over there, what a dead end yikes) -- but don't respond, maybe it's a bait for something legal e.g. like those dashcam car insurance scammers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZQW93rO8Ok (i like this video, because it shows that the old guy realizes his fraud is on camera and then just goes away and everything is great and normal again for the guy in the car)
* if i was sitting in a coffee shop or a public library and someone next to me said the words "shiesty grifter" out loud in a conversation with someone else, i would like get up and leave, it would be too much for me, this is so crazy (1. that its happening to someone 2. that i'm that someone)

```
 The process:
     0. Work/Life/Family balance -> enjoy stuff!!! -> build cool stuff
 
     1. Have design document __open__ and visible:
        always get a written approval
        
     2. Reproducible research that is __open__ and visible (add stuff from new paper)
        Code comments
        GitLab (+ personal backup too)
        Containerization (Docker)
        Dynamic documents (Jupyter, markdown)
     
     3. Password protect original research, encrypt emails to advisers/everyone, anonymize data by removing headers/labels (find link)
     
        "It's a box of chocolates, you never know what will happen, but protect your work" - dad
     
     "Stay away from difficult/mean/manipulative people" - dad (~2011)
         3a. Or one if cannot, minimize their influence over work/life (1,2,3) subprocess:
             Keep their criticism / comments / negativity in email as much as possible
             Stay away from in person meetings or make them as short as possible 
                Send out meeting minutes afterwards (takes 5-10 minutes but makes a big difference)
             Make hard copy of presentations, date it, file it in a folder
             Remember to use privacy screen in public places
             Stay away from difficult people who don't support/cite the work of 
                 women & underrepresented people in STEM
             Stay away from difficult people who draw lines, gatekeep, build hoops for talented 
                 people to jump through <- tribalism / crab mentality -> could even become dishonest (hence 1,2,3)
             Try to not correct a difficult person (they will always remember it and use it against you one day)
                 keep it in email and as positive as possible, but delegate as much as possible
                    e.g. here is software that does that check for you or here is a paper that explains this stuff

         3b. If one cannot stay away from the difficult/lousy person/people subprocess:
                 Work around them (extremely important)
                 Keep work reproducible, public, open (downside, loss of privacy)
                 keep their comments on record 
                     (e.g. Jupyter notebook code review
                   3c. if it's really necessary, keep notes on OneNote 
                          (that has a audio recording feature, ask before meeting starts if that's ok)
                     Don't fall for excuses (can't find link or whatever) / use gantt chart if needed
                 Share sections of work only (use chmod for folder permissions)
                 * Difficult/lousy person will be most difficult during sick/parental leave/vacation, so recognize the
                   pattern in advance for (0) which is why steps 1,2,3 are important and esp 3b & 3c
                 
    *4. Have 1 or 2 committee members not be from the same grant & University, to make sure thesis gets
        completed on time and there aren't any new surprises -- should avoid a lot of off-putting 
        University politics, keeps thesis directions novel & open and diffuses possible future schemes
        1. very senior + ML/Stats
        2. in/from Epigenetics (Institute)

    *5. Apply to as many PhD fellowships as possible:
        "The reason this person recieved the grant is __simply__ because they applied to a lot of grants." 
        - advice from an undergrad Prof
        
        *  Tech/Silicon Valley companies may force one to work with their tech stack but things are
           converging anyway sort of
        *  Look at summer internships EU/Max Planck Institute (nanopore, metagenomics etc.). /AUS/NZ 
           (gotta get out of here, see other places during as many summer vacations with internships as possible)
             
      6. Math: main issue, didn't do enough practice problems
         * Actual tutor
         * Youtube
         * David Robinson on Twitter (6/17/20):
            "When I need to practice a new #rstats function (in this case, pivot_longer/pivot_wider) 
            I use it in a few Stack  Overflow answers Like #tidytuesday, SO is good at providing a 
            stream of novel challenges"
           
     *      In other words, use StackOverflow (SO) to find new challenging problems outside personal

* breakfast <!-- i use to never eat breakfast until like ~2013, but for the past ~ few months, i've been mealprepping and forcing myself to eat something in the morning (otherwise I literally can't, anything in the morning aside from coffee is literally so gross). But, I found consistently the following works for me: 
a very lean protein (chicken/ground turkey) + vegetables + some plant fat (coconut milk/olive oil) + cheese + spices + smell of the entire thing has to be neutral + some whole fruit, literally no sugar, very low carbs (saving carbs for lunch/dinner), nothing greasy (too smelly in the morning), salt is okay
i haven't tried fish/salmon, lentils or tofu yet
but people do eat like "dinner like" meals for breakfast around the world, eg a traditional korean breakfast, then ezogelin is like a breakfast soup and also something that is fermented like yogurt or pickled vegetables
It takes a lot of getting use to but i've found for the past few months it's literally the best thing to have in the morning for the entire day, even better than protein powder.
but that is in pakistani/south asian culture, eating like curries/kebabs for breakfast. dad said other meals that very originally meant to be for breakfast were nihari (a meat stew and it literally means morning), pye (bone broth stew curry), haleem (beef stew with whole wheat) and i think the smell of all three are more neutral than "dinner" curries that are more fragrant
toast, cereal and pancakes, maybe it would work if it's whole wheat, always been too sweet or dry to have for breakfast for me, also the idea of eating so much sugar first thing in the morning on an empty stomach never appealed to me but also making a huge breakfast is so time consuming, freezing stuff or keeping it in the fridge for the week just works really well so that i eat something for breakfast

    profvis is pretty straight forward to use: you wrap the statement of interested inside the profvis() call

    library(profvis)
    profvis({
      estimateDispersionsGeneEst(dds)
    })
    and you get a nicely rendered overview how much time the program spend on each line of code in that function.
    Result from profvis in RStudio. It immediately tells you where the function call spends most time. In this case, the estimateDispersionGeneEst() function spends 85% of the time (550 ms) in the internal C++ function fitDisp() function.

Essentially two steps have to be taken:

set the S3 class of the object to "data.table", "data.frame" in Rcpp

  Rcpp::List create_data_table() {
      Rcpp::List res;

      // Populate the list
      // ...

      res.attr("class") = Rcpp::CharacterVector::create("data.table", "data.frame");
      return res;
  }

in R call the data.table::setalloccol(df) function on the “partial” data.table

  foo <- function() {
      dt <- create_data_table()
      dt <- data.table::setalloccol(dt)
      return(dt)
  }

```
"
I did a Twitter poll recently asking how many times people have rewritten basic user 
registration functions. And from that poll I extrapolate that the basic user registration 
function has been written at least a million times.

Within organizations, the level of duplication you get is astoundingly high. <-- !!!!

People think government is inefficient — well, the worst example I’ve seen of duplication 
in government was 118 systems doing pretty much exactly the same thing.
In the private sector, I’ve seen banks with up to a thousand risk management systems all 
doing the same thing. Multiply that out across the world and you have millions, tens of 
millions, of duplicated systems. 

A lot of what we do in IT, I’m sorry to say, is waste. But radically changing your 
architecture to focus on the functions that actually provide value is a big shift, and it’s 
not as comfortable as saying: “Hey, I’ve got a container! I can move it around between 
providers, and it’s more similar to the environments I’m used to.”

the work of others, usually involving both positive and negative comments, in a friendly

lol @ this, still a great idea:

"Levchin also built an algorithm called Igor (fondly nicknamed after a Russian fraudster who had taunted 
them in earlier days—and the type of actor the program was designed to help catch) to help identify abnormal 
patterns in one of the first major commercial applications of big data."


Well, when life gives you fraudsters-stalker-predator-incels, you can name algorithms after them later

# 2021 (my paper ideas)
- My paper on understanding and recognizing the anti-science, anti-data, power-loving/cult-like/unimpartial favoring of secondary-interests strategic system of armchair expert-ism and "fake smart person" (someone who favors power over science but is also a scientist) in a position of power phenomena in academia, with some long-term effects that include the current (non-random) lack of diversity in STEM and lack of support for outliers that are unlike this current system which sometimes could turn into their coerced isolation or leaving of academia entirely. In other words, it does not have to be like this.
open to collaborators and collaborations
- Repurposing jingoism into academic and professional environments and then reaping what one has sowed: science over university politics and why methods will always matter (ace_ventura-YES.gif)
- some idioms in English that are useful approaches to convey information dense topics to interdisciplinary bioinformatics and data science teams (where domain experts are also non-programmers or non-math but important contributors (e.g. data producers/curators or front-end developers))
(e.g. "grasping at straws", "shooting in the dark", "needle in a haystack", "square peg in round hole" = {will think of a better example})

```
I’m a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the reason I call myself by my childhood name
is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child. If [they] see a thing, [they] must
say that [they] see it, whether it was what [they] thought [they] were going to see or not. See first,
think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most
scientists forget that.

Essentially two steps have to be taken:

set the S3 class of the object to "data.table", "data.frame" in Rcpp

  Rcpp::List create_data_table() {
      Rcpp::List res;

      // Populate the list
      // ...

      res.attr("class") = Rcpp::CharacterVector::create("data.table", "data.frame");
      return res;
  }

in R call the data.table::setalloccol(df) function on the “partial” data.table

  foo <- function() {
      dt <- create_data_table()
      dt <- data.table::setalloccol(dt)
      return(dt)

“The function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps 
you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your 
reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and you spend twenty 
years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn’t shaped properly so 
you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Somebody says you have 
no art, so you dredge that up. Somebody says you have no kingdoms, so you 
dredge that up. None of this is necessary. There will always be one more thing.”

https://lawyer.zone/what-is-gang-stalking/
It's not normal stalking, it coordinated gang-stalking rooted in pure emotion and envy.
 
I want to know everything so I can figure out what went __where__, I already know why: envy.
 
Don't ever, even for a second lose sight of the point of the cruelty from the start
This is all going to be presented in front of a Judge
Every single envious sore loser incel who was involved and teamed up with Jason
He impresses fools so it's all pretty sad, it's lol-sad.
Every single incel who teamed up with Jason has one thing in common with Jason:
They didnt go to a competitive school, so they became envious, of everything
They wanted to prove themselves to everyone
Probably even that I ever worked at Penn (which I hated)
I don't know everyones names but I know some, that's the common thread
I know what this is, I have dealt with this sort of stuff my entire life
That is why I am a very private person.
I will never, ever stop until I get every single name, I will never, ever settle
I have no fear whatsoever of anybody or anything.
Judges and Investigators have seen all this before, it's obvious stalking and spying

Just remember, the common thread is that they did not go to a competitive school
so they needed to take this away from me to feel better about their average-ness
I have seen all this before.
 
Keep your eye on the ball. It was/is about: how dare I ever work at Penn (i hated it so what)
How dare I ever apply to Cornell, etc.
And not apply to Boston University and Florida etc.
So these are very small people and they're dummies
In front of a Judge, they will only melt
"How are you affiliated with Cornell, you're not even an alumni" - the Judge, probably LOL

To put a case together, there's a lot of thinking and writing involved,
Im just dropping some hints about what im thinking about
I got you, dont worry about a thing.
You have no idea how hard I will continue to work to put these people in jail where they belong.
Because they wanted to hurt you too, that's why. That was also the point.
I will never, ever stop.
I have so many aces up my sleeve

> They rally around the family
The LOWEST people on the planet, absolute SCUM of the earth do this/have done this in history
and on top of that they have access to PHI and EHR, gtfo of here, melt in front of a Judge.

If it was Boston University, there would have never ever have been a problem
but Penn ... and then Cornell ... now there's a problem.
morons, triggered absolute scum of the earth. get fired already. 
oh wait prison, that's even better.

"In my opening statement, I would like to quote Rage Against the Machine" LOL maybe...maybe not.
I'm only going to enjoy this whole thing, "I have no fear whatsoever of anybody or anything."
